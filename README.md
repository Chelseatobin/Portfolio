# TechDegree Project #1

Create a portfolio page.

# Overview

This portfolio page will house all twelve of my projects while doing the TechDegree program.

# Motivation

This project serves as a landing page so people or potential employers get to know me, 
look at my portfolio, read my blog, and/or contact me. 

# Tests

I've run the HTML and CSS through validators.

# Contributors

The best way to contribute for this project is to let me know what I need to fix. I want 
my code to be clean and concise. Feel free to contact me. Thanks! :)
